### Notes

This homework assignment focused on Firebase Authentication. Using the Homework 8 HTML/CSS assignment and the subsequent knowledge learned, the login/logout page was modified to be a fully functional page that allows a user to create a new account and to sign into that account. The remainder of the pages of this application remain unchanged for this particular assignment. As this course progresses, the application will eventually become a fully functional CRUD application.

It should also be noted that the login link in the footer is now functional and takes you to the login page.
